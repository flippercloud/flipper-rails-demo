    <h1>A Basic Feature Toggle</h1>
    <p>You can toggle any feature on/off <strong>for everyone</strong> without re-deploying. You can think of this as <a href="https://www.flippercloud.io/docs/features#enablement-boolean">boolean feature flipping</a> where it's either true or false for everyone. In this example, the Demo is behind a flag named <code>demo</code>. To enable (or disable) it, you make a call to Flipper.</p>
    <p>That's the simplest case, and whenever you use those methods, it's all-or-nothing for every user.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Demo mode is <del>disabled</del> since <strong>Flipper features are disabled by default</strong>.</p>
    <p>In most cases, you wouldn't let folks toggle features for themselves, but it can be handy for letting them opt-in to test out new features ahead of a public release. We'll use it to enable the demo.</p>
    <div class="example">
      <%= button_to "Enable Demo", enable_path(feature: :demo), method: :post %>
      <code>Flipper.enable(:demo)</code>
    </div>
