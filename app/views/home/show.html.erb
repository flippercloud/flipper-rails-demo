  This is a minimal Rails app that you can browse and interact with to see how Flipper worksâ€”a kind of virtual playground.
</p>

<p>If there's something you like, <mark>the footer of every page provides a link to the source code so you can take a look at how we did it</mark> and even use it in your own Rails app! If there's something you don't like, you can tinker with it and change it to figure out how it works or how you could use it.</p>

<% if current_user.present? %>
  <div class="d-flex gap-3 my-5">
    <%= link_to "Start the Demo", demo_start_path, class: "btn btn-lg btn-primary" %>
    <%#= link_to "Browse Examples", '#', class: "btn btn-lg btn-primary" %>
  </div>
<% end %>

<% content_for :aside do %>
  <%= controls('About the Demo') do %>
      <% if current_user.present? %>
        <p class="my-0">Once you walk through the demo or browse the examples, this area will display information and controls for some Flipper controls. Normally, you'd use Flipper Cloud to control feature flags, but for demonstration purposes, we've brought those controls right here.</p>
      <% else %>
        <p>Before we can do much, you'll need to create an account for the demo application or log in so you have an account that can work with the tour and examples. Then the tour will walk you through how it all works with real examples and real code.</p>

      <% end %>
  <% end %>
<% end %>
