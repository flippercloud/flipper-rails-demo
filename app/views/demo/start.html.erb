  <h1>Nice flag toggling!</h1>

  <p>You're ready to take Flipper for a spin and enable features on a more specific basis now!</p>

  <hr>

  <p>Our first example focuses on enabling features for a specific userâ€”you!</p>

  <%= button_to "Learn How to Toggle Features for Individual actors", demo_actor_path, method: :get, class: 'btn btn-lg btn-primary' %>

<% else %>

  <h1>Enable the Demo Feature Flag</h1>
  <p>You can toggle any feature on/off <strong>for everyone</strong> without re-deploying. You can think of this as <a href="https://www.flippercloud.io/docs/features#enablement-boolean">boolean feature flipping</a> where it's either true or false for everyone. That's the simplest case, and whenever you use those methods, it's all-or-nothing for every user.</p>

  <p>In this example, the Demo is behind a flag named <code>demo</code>. To enable (or disable) it, you make a call to Flipper. <mark>All reads of feature flag values are always performed entirely local to your application to avoid roundtrip network requests.</mark></p>

  <p>Throughout the demo, you'll use the &ldquo;Flipper Controls&rdquo; to toggle the relevant flags and then see the primary content updated here to reflect the updated state of the feature flag.</p>

<% content_for :aside do %>
  <%= controls('About the Demo') do %>
    <% if current_user && Flipper.enabled?(:demo) %>
      <p>Demo mode is <ins>enabled</ins>! It's that easy. You can toggle it off and back on again if you want&hellip;</p>
      <hr>
      <%= toggle(
        label: 'Disable the Demo Feature Flag',
        form_target: disable_path(feature: :demo),

        code: 'Flipper.disable(:demo)'
        ) %>
    <% elsif current_user %>
      <p>In most cases, you wouldn't let folks toggle features for themselves, but it can be handy for letting them opt-in to test out new features ahead of a public release.</p>
      <p>We'll use it here to enable the demo for everyone.</p>

      <hr>

      <p>Demo mode is <del>disabled</del> since <strong>Flipper features are disabled by default</strong>.</p>

        code: 'Flipper.enable(:demo)'
        ) %>
    <% elsif !current_user %>
      <p>Before starting the demo, you'll need to create an account for the demo application or log in so you have an account that can work with the demo. Then the demo will walk you through how it all works with real examples and real code.</p>
